    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        Welcome, to the home of my favorite recipes!
        This project is part of the Odin projects open source 
        web development cirriculum. In this very webpage, I have
        put my skills to use to bring you a concise list of the absolute
        necessities I would need to live on a deserted island.
    </p>
    <p>
        Just kidding, I would be a little bit smarter with my choices.
        The guacamole is still coming with me though.
